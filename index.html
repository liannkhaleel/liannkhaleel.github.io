<h2> <strong>Why Cats Make <i>Great</i> Pets</h2>
<p>Cats make exceptionally great pets, especially for those who are looking to have a pet that is more independent yet very loving at the same time. Their silence and subtlety shouldn't fool you because these furballs will offer their unconditional love and affection even in the most unconventional ways. Although all cats are different by character, they all require care, attention and love.</strong></p>

<p class="info">Cats make exceptionally great pets, especially for those who are looking to have a pet that is more independent yet very loving at the same time. Their silence and subtlety shouldn't fool you because these furballs will offer their unconditional love and affection even in the most unconventional ways. Although all cats are different by character, they all require care, attention and love.</p>

<p class="info"> Free ranging domestic cats have a large impact on biodiversity. 
This may pose a financial problem, especially for less economically developed countries where it becomes harder for government organizations to allocate financial resources to TNR initiatives. <span style="color:red;">Humane</span> practices for decreasing stray animal populations exist and need the help of awareness through media campaigns to educate the public. Killing stray animals is not the best solution to controlling the stray animal population. The best method would be to implement the TNR method and educate the local community on adressing issues regarding stray animals, mitigating the effets that domestic/free-ranging cats have on biodiversity and the responsibilities that come with owning a pet.
